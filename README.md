### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a statistician who loves running experiments and discovering new things through data. I'm currently working on "unmasking the mystery of masking tape" and always looking for new challenges.

* 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use **pymc** for bayesian statistics in python.
* 🤔 I’m looking for help with **causal inference and bayesian statistics in industry**.
* 💬 Ask me about **Statistical Analysis in R and Python**.
* 📫 How to reach me: **j.riley.wilkinson@gmail.com**
* ⚡ Fun fact: **I love baking!** check out the bread-bayesian-analysis repo to see how I use statistics to become a better baker 😉
